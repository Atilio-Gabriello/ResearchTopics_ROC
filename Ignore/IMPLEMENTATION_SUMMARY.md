# Hull Comparison Implementation Summary

## Overview

I've implemented a comprehensive hull comparison functionality that removes the original convex hull points from a ROC curve and recalculates the hull with the remaining points. This allows you to analyze how the ROC convex hull changes at each depth of the search algorithm.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Core Function: `remove_hull_points_and_recalculate()`
Located in `true_roc_search.py` (lines ~202-305)

**Purpose:** Remove points on the original convex hull and recalculate with remaining points.

**Features:**
- Filters points to only those above the diagonal (TPR > FPR)
- Calculates original convex hull with anchor points (0,0) and (1,1)
- Removes hull points from the point set
- Recalculates convex hull with remaining points
- Computes area reduction statistics

**Returns:**
```python
{
    'original_hull': array of original hull points,
    'new_hull': array of new hull points,
    'removed_points': points that were on original hull,
    'remaining_points': points not on original hull,
    'all_points': all points above diagonal,
    'original_hull_area': float,
    'new_hull_area': float,
    'hull_area_reduction': float,
    'reduction_percentage': float
}
```

### 2. Visualization Function: `plot_hull_comparison()`
Located in `true_roc_search.py` (lines ~307-397)

**Purpose:** Create a three-panel visualization comparing hulls.

**Panels:**
1. **Original Hull**: All points with original convex hull highlighted
2. **New Hull**: Remaining points with recalculated hull
3. **Comparison Overlay**: Both hulls overlaid with area reduction statistics

**Features:**
- Automatic sorting of hull points for proper polygon drawing
- Color-coded points and hulls
- Statistics in title (area reduction, reduction percentage)
- Grid and diagonal reference line
- Saves to file if output_path provided

### 3. Demonstration Function: `demonstrate_hull_comparison()`
Located in `true_roc_search.py` (lines ~1395-1426)

**Purpose:** Standalone function to demonstrate hull comparison with full output.

**Features:**
- Prints detailed statistics to console
- Creates visualization
- Returns complete hull data dictionary
- Easy to use for testing and demonstrations

### 4. Integration with `true_roc_search()`

**Modified sections:**
- **Line ~705**: Added `hull_comparisons = []` to track hull data
- **Line ~723**: Modified `generate_candidates()` to return hull comparison data
- **Lines ~725-743**: Added hull comparison analysis at each depth
- **Line ~817**: Added hull comparisons to results dictionary

**Benefits:**
- Automatically tracks hull evolution across all depths
- No extra function calls needed by user
- Results saved alongside other search metrics

### 5. Enhanced `generate_candidates()`

**Modified return (line ~644):**
```python
return candidates, hull_comparison
```

**Returns additional data:**
```python
hull_comparison = {
    'all_points': all candidate points,
    'original_hull_points': points on hull,
    'original_hull_indices': hull vertex indices,
    'ch_eligible': points above diagonal
}
```

### 6. Updated `save_results()`

**New section (lines ~1082-1111):**
- Creates `hull_comparisons/` subdirectory
- Saves `hull_comparison_summary.csv` with statistics
- Generates comparison plots for each depth
- Integrates seamlessly with existing result structure

### 7. Test Script: `test_hull_comparison.py`

**Complete test suite including:**

**Test 1: Basic Hull Comparison**
- Generates 50 sample ROC points
- Runs hull comparison
- Creates visualization

**Test 2: Multiple Depths**
- Simulates different depths with varying point counts
- Compares hull evolution
- Creates summary table

**Test 3: Edge Cases**
- Very few points (3)
- Points below diagonal
- Many points (200)

**Test 4: Summary Visualization**
- Bar charts of hull areas
- Area reduction percentages
- Cross-depth comparison

### 8. Documentation: `HULL_COMPARISON_GUIDE.md`

**Comprehensive guide including:**
- Function documentation with examples
- Integration instructions
- Output file descriptions
- Use cases and interpretation guidelines
- Best practices
- Troubleshooting

## How to Use

### Basic Usage

```python
from true_roc_search import remove_hull_points_and_recalculate
import numpy as np

# Your ROC points
points = np.array([[0.1, 0.3], [0.2, 0.6], [0.3, 0.7]])

# Get detailed comparison
hull_data = remove_hull_points_and_recalculate(points, return_details=True)

print(f"Original hull area: {hull_data['original_hull_area']:.4f}")
print(f"New hull area: {hull_data['new_hull_area']:.4f}")
print(f"Reduction: {hull_data['reduction_percentage']:.1f}%")
```

### Automatic Integration

```python
from true_roc_search import true_roc_search, load_data

data = load_data('./tests/adult.txt')
results = true_roc_search(data, 'target', alphas=[0.5], max_depth=3)

# Access hull comparisons
for hull_data in results[0.5]['hull_comparisons']:
    print(f"Depth {hull_data['depth']}: "
          f"{hull_data['reduction_percentage']:.1f}% area reduction")
```

### Run Tests

```bash
python test_hull_comparison.py
```

## Output Examples

### Console Output
```

## Technical Details

### Algorithm

1. **Filter points**: Keep only points above diagonal (TPR > FPR)
2. **Add anchors**: Include (0,0) and (1,1) for complete ROC space
3. **Compute original hull**: Use scipy.spatial.ConvexHull
4. **Identify hull points**: Extract vertex indices
5. **Remove hull points**: Create subset of non-hull points
6. **Recalculate hull**: Compute new hull with remaining points
7. **Calculate metrics**: Areas, reductions, percentages

### Performance

- **Time complexity**: O(n log n) for convex hull calculation
- **Space complexity**: O(n) for point storage
- **Handles**: Up to thousands of points efficiently
- **Edge cases**: Gracefully handles <3 points, all below diagonal

### Dependencies

- numpy: Array operations
- scipy.spatial: ConvexHull calculation
- matplotlib: Visualization
- pandas: CSV export

All dependencies already present in `true_roc_search.py`.

## Summary

This implementation provides a complete solution for analyzing ROC convex hull evolution by removing hull points and recalculating. It's fully integrated into the existing codebase, well-documented, and tested. The functionality automatically tracks hull changes at each search depth and provides rich visualizations and statistics for analysis.
